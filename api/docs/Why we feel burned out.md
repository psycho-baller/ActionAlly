# working overtime
- once or twice every now and then where the consequences of working overtime is minimal to nothing is fine but when you go overtime and that ruins in some way, any other part of your life that's destructive and a major cause of burnout
# Not feeling accomplished
- this is a big one in my opinion because sometimes I work the whole day for multiple days and not feel burnt out as long as that's what I actually want to do. And it's not me working overtime (as mentioned before) and I actually feel accomplished by the end of it then I enjoy it and want to have more of these days. Unfortunately that doesn't happen all the time and in the days where bedtime arrives and I couldn't do something that could make me feel accomplished, I tend to do one of two things either I just accept my defeat and go to bed (the right decision). Or continue working until I feel accomplished. But unfortunately your emotional metric that decides if You've accomplished, something or not is messed at that time, you think you're doing progress by staying awake, but in reality you're just ruining the next day for yourself which will in turn lead to the same thing happening again the next day. And in a few days, you would've guaranteed a spot in the "burnt out" list.
